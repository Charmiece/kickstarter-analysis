# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

    We created a pivot table and used formulas in order to analyze the data.

### Purpose

    The purpose of the project was to compare successful projects against failed ones. Theater Outcomes bassed on Launch Date creates a view by month of successes, faiures, and cancellations. The Outcomes Based on Goals gives you the numbers and percentages of successes and failures.

## Analysis and Challenges
    Overall the date can pull some valuable information. I think one of the challenges will be the qualitive data. What made projects more successful vs the failures. This data could become cumbersome and hard to analize but I think it could provide some information for parties to keep doing the right things and staying away from the less ideal.
    

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    This data shows that the most succesful projects being in late Spring through the summer months. This shows that there would be better success during this time.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    Projects with goals of less than $20,000 have a higher level of success. There may be some relationship the amount being asked for and the success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

       One of the challenges with the Outcome Based on Goals was the amount of time it took to set up the data. There was no easy way to set up the ranges. Because each formula was unique, it could not be copy draged for the remaining. The easiest way for me to do it was to make any cells that were stationary, permament. This way when I copied and pasted, I only had to change no more than a couple things.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    It appears that most successful theater projects were in the May, June and July months. Those months also held the most volume.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    It appears that the most success projects were the cheaper ones. The $20,000 or less projects has a success rate of 50% or more

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    This data is very quantitive. There is not enough qualitive data that would help investors or project managers make better decisions.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    There may be a way to get more qualitive information by narrowing down the genre that people suppoert the most. I would also like to see if the projects that had a goal of less than $20,000 had a higher pleged amount.
